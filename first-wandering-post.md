# First Wandering Post

So I am going to try to figure out what my goals are by trying to explain them to you, the reader. The goal of my exercise is to figure out how to optimally ensure that any prospective writer can use `git` and [Github](https://github.com/) to manage their versions and achieve their goals.

## Goals:

1. Create a website documenting how to use git to manage your writing material
2. Add documentation for including an editor into the process
3. Encourage Tyler and Jordon and Chris to use this workflow
4. Find or create an editor that makes markdown easy to use and easy to share with other people for editing.

I would honestly really love to find out how to render math server-side reliably so that I can write an extension for commonmark and possibly make a simple extension to pandoc? But the important thing is to generate html+css that doesn't rely on javascript client-side for latex layout.

I would honestly love to just make it so that we can have a useful dialog box that follows you around as it explains how to create your first repo and a bunch of stuff - I really want the usefulness of YNAB documentation and tech-support but for git-for-writers.
