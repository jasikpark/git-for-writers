# so... can we make a website with the style stolen from tokio-rs or something that teaches writers how to use git?

a side-note : would it be possible to make a custom web-component that is called "latex"? or a "math" custom html tag? so basically I can write

<math>3x+2y</math>

and get a beautifully rendered equation out of it???? I feel like that would be possible.

so, incidentally, there's a mathjax-node library that could possibly be used to render math to html+css offline. If I could package that up into a command line solution, that would be great.
